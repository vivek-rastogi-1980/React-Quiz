Project Title: React Learning Quiz App
Prepared By: Vivek Rastogi ‚Äî Senior Software Analyst
Date: 12 June 2025
________________________________________
üìå Project Overview:
The React Learning Quiz App is an interactive, single-session quiz application designed to help users test and improve their knowledge of React essentials. The app will present a set of 50 randomized questions sourced from a local JSON file, with real-time tracking of attempts and scores, a flashcard-based interaction model, and the ability to retest failed questions.
The application will be built using React + Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS, and will operate entirely in the browser without user authentication.

üìå Technology Stack:
‚Ä¢	Frontend Framework: React (with Vite)
‚Ä¢	Styling: Tailwind CSS
‚Ä¢	State Management: React Hooks / Context API (if needed)
‚Ä¢	Data Storage: Local JSON file for questions, localStorage for session persistence (e.g., retest)
‚Ä¢	Build Tool: Vite

üìå Core Features & Requirements:
1Ô∏è‚É£ User Name Input:
‚Ä¢	Prompt user to enter their name before starting the quiz (required field).
‚Ä¢	Display the user‚Äôs name prominently in the app header throughout the session.
________________________________________
2Ô∏è‚É£ Quiz Structure:
‚Ä¢	50 total questions loaded from a local JSON file.
‚Ä¢	Questions will be randomized on each quiz start.
‚Ä¢	Questions distributed by difficulty:
o	30% Easy
o	50% Medium
o	20% Hard
(difficulty tags managed internally in JSON, but not shown to user)
________________________________________
3Ô∏è‚É£ Question Presentation:
‚Ä¢	Questions displayed as flashcards with:
o	Question text on the front
o	Multiple-choice options (radio buttons or buttons)
o	Flip interaction reveals:
ÔÇß	The correct answer
ÔÇß	A success/failure message:
ÔÇß	‚úÖ ‚ÄúYou are correct!‚Äù
ÔÇß	‚ùå ‚ÄúIncorrect. The correct answer was‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Use subtle animations for card flipping using CSS transitions or React libraries (optional).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Score Tracking:
Header section will display:
‚Ä¢	User Name
‚Ä¢	Number of Questions Attempted
‚Ä¢	Number of Correct Answers
‚Ä¢	Number of Incorrect Answers
‚Ä¢	Number of Remaining Questions
________________________________________
5Ô∏è‚É£ End of Quiz Flow:
‚Ä¢	Display a Finish Quiz button after all questions are attempted.
‚Ä¢	Show a Quiz Summary:
o	Total Correct
o	Total Incorrect
o	Score Percentage
‚Ä¢	If any questions were answered incorrectly:
o	Show a Retest Failed Questions button.
o	Retest will immediately present only the failed questions in a fresh flashcard format.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Data Persistence (localStorage):
‚Ä¢	Store failed questions temporarily in localStorage.
‚Ä¢	Clear localStorage on session completion or new quiz start.

üìå Data Structure (Question JSON Example)
json
CopyEdit
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of useState in React?",
    "options": [
      "To create routing paths",
      "To manage component state",
      "To fetch data from an API",
      "To render lists"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "To manage component state",
    "difficulty": "Easy"
  },
  ...
]
________________________________________
üìå Non-Functional Requirements:
‚Ä¢	Performance: Fast load and render performance using Vite.
‚Ä¢	Responsiveness: Fully responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
‚Ä¢	Accessibility: Use ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support for flashcards and buttons.
‚Ä¢	Code Maintainability: Modular, clean component structure with reusable components.
________________________________________
üìå Optional Future Enhancements:
‚Ä¢	Progress Bar for quiz completion
‚Ä¢	Dark/Light Mode toggle
‚Ä¢	Review All Answers summary after quiz
‚Ä¢	Share Score option
(currently out of scope but easy to implement later)
________________________________________
üìå Assumptions:
No authentication or backend services required.

Quiz data remains static unless updated in the JSON file.

No timer or time tracking for questions.

No sound or audio feedback.
________________________________________
üìå Risks & Limitations:
Browser localStorage limits may affect quiz persistence on older devices or private mode.

JSON-based question storage lacks scalability beyond local usage.
